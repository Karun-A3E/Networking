## Overview
This project is a Python implementation of cryptography encryption, including RSA, AES, MD5 hash, and digital signatures. The project has two files: server.py and client.py, which are used to demonstrate the encryption and decryption of messages between a server and a client.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.10.8
- Pycryptodome (**`pip install pycryptodome`**)
- lazyme (** pip install lazyme **)
- crypto (** pip install crypto **)
- tabulate (** pip install tabulate **)
## **Installation**

-  Unzip the File and open the folder in VScode or any IDE

## **Usage**

- Open 2 terminals
- In each terminal, change directory into either client or server =>
  > In one terminal, change directory to 'cd server'
  > In other terminal, change directory to 'cd client'
-Run the 'server.py' in terminal that is in the server directory, by typing in : python server.py
-After setting the server, run the client.py in the terminal in the client directory, by typing in client.py

## **License**
